New in Town is a multi-stage, story-driven, settler's experience Data Pack for Minecraft version 1.19. You are tasked with founding, building up, and defending a modular settlement from the forces of the Nether, then taking the fight to them as you construct your own Nether Fortress! It is partially inspired by the long-discontinued **Tale of Kingdoms** mod, and seeks to recreate and expand on the town-building gameplay it popularized.

Starting from humble beginnings -- a settler's wagon -- employ the help of your Town Planner's expertise to build new settlement sites, from Mines and Lumber Mills to the Wizard Tower and Bard's College. As your town grows, invaders from the Nether will emerge nearby, seeking to destroy you. Their attacks will grow more fierce, eventually culminating in the appearance of the Tyrant himself, a mighty Wither!

### New in Town features the following:
```
> Multiplayer compatibility; each player can found their own town or work as a group
> A natural progression system that doesn't detract from normal Minecraft gameplay
> Fully modular town, fortress, and city construction and layout, from what you build, where you build it, and in what order
> Hours of side content in the form of quests, random events, and research tasks
> More than 80 structures spread across three dimensions
> Progressively more challenging attacks from the Nether
> Randomly generated natural features to explore, from a floating island to an ancient drill
> Taxes, resource gathering, and interaction with your villagers' economy
> Advancements to provide interesting goals as well as story beats
> Room to grow; more structures, natural features, and story beats may be added in the future
> And more!
```

### What to expect when you download New in Town:
1. The Data Pack Zip File includes a Readme with helpful instructions for installing the data pack, as well as a strategy guide to help you get started and explain various time-and-progression mechanics, like Nether attacks.
2. When you load your world with New in Town installed successfully, you'll receive the Town Charter when you collect a Log. (Any log can get you a Town Charter, but Oak Logs are the only type that will work for building town structures.) Click the text in that book, and your Wagon will generate around you.
3. IMPORTANT: It is not recommended that you start your settlement near a large body of water, and especially not in the middle of an ocean. This can cause naturally generating features to generate very near or overwriting your Wagon, or not generate at all, as well as cause Nether attacks to destroy parts of your Wagon or town. You will receive a warning prompt if New in Town detects this as a risk.

### Uninstallation Instructions:
Before removing New in Town from your world, use "/function nitk:uninstall" to clean up excess entities. The villagers in towns, fortresses, and end cities, as well as the structures themselves, will remain, but all other features of New in Town will not work. The villagers will remain persistent, but players will become able to kill them if they choose. You will need to perform this action at all areas where New in Town features exist, including in each dimension, as New in Town does not forceload these areas.
